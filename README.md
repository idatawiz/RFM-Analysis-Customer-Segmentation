# RFM-Analysis-Customer-Segmentation
In this RFM analysis project, I explored customer transaction data to gain valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences. Here are the key findings:

- On average, customers make 8-10 transactions, indicating moderate engagement.
- The months of May and December exhibit higher transaction frequencies, suggesting potential seasonal patterns or events influencing customer behavior.
- Customers tend to spend more monetary value during January, May, and December, indicating potential opportunities for targeted promotions during these months.
- Weekdays see higher customer spending compared to weekends, with Fridays standing out as the day when customers tend to spend more.
- The frequency of transactions is slightly higher on weekdays, highlighting the importance of considering weekdays for promotional activities.
- Recently visited customers show higher transaction frequencies compared to older customers, indicating the need for effective customer retention strategies to maintain loyalty.
